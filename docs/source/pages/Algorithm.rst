Algorithm
=========================================================

Overview
---------


MembraneCurvature calculates mean and Gaussian curvature of surfaces derived
from atoms of reference in 4 steps:

:ref:`select-atoms`

:ref:`set-grid`

:ref:`derive-surface-curvature` 

:ref:`iterate`

A summary of the algorithm used in MembraneCurvature is shown in the following
diagram:

.. _select-atoms:

1. Select atoms of reference
-----------------------------

The first step in the algorithm consists of selecting atoms that will be used as
a reference to derive a surface. This selection will be contained in an
:class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup`. Typically in biological membranes,
lipid headgroups are the most common elements to use as an AtomGroup of
reference.

.. _set-grid:

2. Set grid
-------------
The dimensions of the grid are determined by the size of the simulation box
contained in the :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.universe.Universe`. The grid comprises 
``n_x_bins`` x ``n_y_bins`` number of bins.

|grid|

For every atom in the :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup` of reference, 
MembraneCurvature assigns an index in the grid, according to their respective 
`x` and `y` coordinates. i.e. ``(x, y) â†¦ [l, m]``. 

.. note::
  Unless the user provides a different input, MembraneCurvature will determine
  the dimensions of the grid based on the size of the box on the first frame via
  :attr:`~MDAnalysis.core.universe.Universe.dimensions`.

  .. code-block:: python

      grid_dimension_x = (0, universe.dimensions[0])
      grid_dimension_y = (0, universe.dimensions[1])

Once the grid is populated according to the coordinates of the atoms in the
AtomGroup of reference, the associated `z` coordinate of each atom in the AtomGroup 
is stored in an array assigned to each ``[l, m]`` index.

.. _derive-surface-curvature:

3. Derive surface and calculate curvature
------------------------------------------

Once the surface formed by the atoms of reference is derived, values of mean (`H`)
and Gaussian (`K`) curvature are calculated according to their respective equations.

For every frame of the trajectory, the surface derived from the 
:class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup` is
calculated and stored in :attr:`~MembraneCurvature.results.z_surface`.
Similarly, the calculation of mean and Gaussian curvature is performed in every
frame and stored in :attr:`MembraneCurvature.results.mean_curvature` and
:attr:`MembraneCurvature.results.gaussian_curvature`, respectively.

.. _iterate:

4. Average over frames
-----------------------------------

The attributes :attr:`MembraneCurvature.results.average_mean` and
:attr:`MembraneCurvature.results.average_gaussian` contain the computed
values of mean and Gaussian curvature averaged over all the 
:attr:`~n_frames` in the trajectory. 

After performing the average over frames, the information of average surface,
mean, and Gaussian curvature are stored in the 
:attr:`MembraneCurvature.results.average_z_surface<membrane_curvature.base.MembraneCurvature.results.average_z_surface>`,
:attr:`MembraneCurvature.results.average_mean`, and
:attr:`MembraneCurvature.results.average_gaussian` arrays, respectively.
Each array has shape ``(n_x_bins, n_y_bins)``.

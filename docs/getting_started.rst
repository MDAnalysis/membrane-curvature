Getting Started
===============

This page details how to get started with MDAnalysis Membrane Curvature 
analysis module.


**Membrane Curvature** is a Python toolkit based on MDAnalysis_ to calculate 
membrane curvature from molecular dynamics files and trajectories. 

This tool enables the user to use Atom selections as a group of reference to 
derive the surfaces of a lipid bilayer.

Getting Started
===============

This page details how to get started with MDAnalysis MembraneCurvature 
analysis tool.

**MembraneCurvature** is a Python toolkit to calculate membrane curvature from
molecular dynamics simulations. This tool enables the user to derive surfaces
from `atoms` in an `AtomGroup` of reference to derive curvature profiles.

Welcome to MembraneCurvature's documentation!
=========================================================

The MDAnalysis MembraneCurvature analysis module calculates the Gaussian and mean 
curvature of lipid bilayers from molecular dynamics simulations. 


Features
----------

MembraneCurvature calculates mean and Gaussian curvature from MD simulations in:

#. Monolayers.
#. Membrane-only systems.
#. Membrane-protein systems.


Why MembraneCurvature?

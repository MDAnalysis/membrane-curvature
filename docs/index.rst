Welcome to MDAkit MembCurv's documentation!
=========================================================

MDAnalysis membrane curvature analysis module calculates gaussian and mean 
curvature of lipid bilayers from molecular dynamics simulations. 

This module returns a 2-dimensional Numpy array, allowing to visualize values
of membrane curvature in 2D maps.

Currently docs are under construction. Use this docs as a reference but at 
your own risk.
